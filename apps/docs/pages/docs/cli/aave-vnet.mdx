# Aave Virtual Testnets [Utilities for creating testnets and executing payloads]

While for aave upgrades the emphasis lies on unit testing, diffing and audits, especially for frontend integrations it can be useful to have a fork with a certain proposal executed.
To streamline this process we've built some tooling on top of [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co) virtual testnets.

## Options

```sh
Usage: @bgd-labs/cli aave-vnet [options]

creates a tenderly virtual testnet and execute payloads

Options:
  --chainId <number>
```

## Usage

```sh
npx @bgd-labs/cli aave-vnet --chainId 1
```

This command will create a virtual testnet, expose the adminRpc and opens a dialog, which allows executing payloads ont he given network.

```sh
Virtual testnet created!
RPC: https://virtual.mainnet.rpc.tenderly.co/<id>
? What do you want to do?
❯ Execute a registered payload
  Execute a deployed (but not registered) payload
  Execute a local payload.
 ──────────────
  Exit (this will keep the vnet open - you can delete it via tenderly ui)
  Exit and delete
```

For people relying on `anvil` we also provide some solidity tooling [aave-helpers](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-helpers/blob/main/src/GovV3Helpers.sol) to execute payloads.
