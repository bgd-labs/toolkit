# Ray Math [A node RayMath.sol implementation based on bigint]

Aave relies on `RayMath.sol` to work with big numbers.
Sometimes it is useful to replicate this logic in node if you want to calculate data without sending requests to a node.

```ts twoslash
import { rayMul, rayDiv, rayToWad, wadToRay, wadDiv } from "@bgd-labs/toolbox";
```
