This pattern implies two\\\\n * things that go hand in hand:\\\\n *\\\\n * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if\\\\n * that call matches the {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy-upgradeToAndCall} function exposed by the proxy itself.\\\\n * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can call the `upgradeToAndCall` function but any other call won't be forwarded to\\\\n * the implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error indicating\\\\n * the proxy admin cannot fallback to the target implementation.\\\\n *\\\\n * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for upgrading the proxy, so it's best if it's a\\\\n * dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due to sudden errors when trying to\\\\n * call a function from the proxy implementation. For this reason, the proxy deploys an instance of {ProxyAdmin} and\\\\n * allows upgrades only if they come through it. You should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the administrative\\\\n * interface of the proxy, including the ability to change who can trigger upgrades by transferring ownership.\\\\n *\\\\n * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not\\\\n * inherit from that interface, and instead `upgradeToAndCall` is implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch\\\\n * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to\\\\n * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the\\\\n * implementation.\\\\n *\\\\n * NOTE: This proxy does not inherit from {Context} deliberately. The {ProxyAdmin} of this contract won't send a\\\\n * meta-transaction in any way, and any other meta-transaction setup should be made in the implementation contract.\\\\n *\\\\n * IMPORTANT: This contract avoids unnecessary storage reads by setting the admin only during construction as an\\\\n * immutable variable, preventing any changes thereafter. However, the admin slot defined in ERC-1967 can still be\\\\n * overwritten by the implementation logic pointed to by this proxy. In such cases, the contract may end up in an\\\\n * undesirable state where the admin slot is different from the actual admin. Relying on the value of the admin slot\\\\n * is generally fine if the implementation is trusted.\\\\n *\\\\n * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the\\\\n * compiler will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new\\\\n * function and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one.
